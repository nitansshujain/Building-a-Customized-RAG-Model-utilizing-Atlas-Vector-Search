Boundary layer control is a complex process that involves physics, engineering, and design. It often involves trade-offs between different aerodynamic parameters, such as drag, lift, noise, and weight. Additionally, it may require additional equipment or materials which can increase cost. Additionally, boundary layer control may be subject to regulation and certification by aviation authorities, limiting its application and innovation. Despite the challenges of boundary layer control, it can be a useful technique for improving the aerodynamic performance of an aircraft. By understanding boundary layer and what methods can be used to control it, you can appreciate the science and art of flying.
